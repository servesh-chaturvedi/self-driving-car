# Self driving car simulation using genetic algorithm

This simulation is built on HTML canvas using OOP principles in Javascript without any libraries. Firstly, a car is developed with physics (accelaration and friction). Then the road is generated and a ray-casting sensor is applied to detect collisions with traffic and road borders. Finally, a neural network is created and visualised. Multiple cars are parallelly simulated to find a network that can safely steer through the traffic. The network is optimised using mutations on a genetic algorithm.
